This is the sample deck corresponding to the <a href="https://github.com/matthayes/anki_cloze_anything" rel="nofollow">Cloze Anything</a> project.  This sample deck will get you started if you don't want to spend time setting up the fields and card templates.  You can use it as a basis for your cards and customize it as you see fit.  The corresponding <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/330680661" rel="nofollow">plugin</a> is also recommended as it makes it easier to edit the cards when following this approach.  Some sample notes have been included in this deck only to give you an example of what the cards look like.

The <a href="https://github.com/matthayes/anki_cloze_anything">Cloze Anything</a> provides a template-based cloze implementation that:

<ul>
<li>is completely independent from Anki's <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-deletion">Cloze Deletion</a>,</li>
<li>does not require any modifications to Anki (via a plugin) for it to work,</li>
<li>and provides more flexibility in cloze card generation</li>
</ul>

This is achieved purely through JavaScript in the card template and a novel application of Anki's built-in (awesome) <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#selective-card-generation">Selective Card Generation</a> feature.  The big benefit of this is that you can generate cloze cards from existing notes, for which you may already have cards.  It has no dependency on Anki's Cloze note type nor any other note types, which means you don't have to migrate your cards to a new note type.  It is compatible with Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile, and AnkiDroid.

Getting started is easy.  You can either download the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1637056056">shared deck</a> or follow the <a href="https://github.com/matthayes/anki_cloze_anything/blob/master/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md">instructions</a> for setting up the templates manually.

Replicating Anki functionality with JavaScript and card templates is not the goal however.  The goal is endless flexibility.  You can add cloze cards to any existing note type ("cloze anything") simply by adding new fields and card templates based on the instructions found here.  You can also modify the templates completely, using them simply as a guide.

Further details on the approach and how the plugin works can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/matthayes/anki_cloze_anything" rel="nofollow">Github page</a>.

Updates:
<ul>
<li>(2019-12-24) Template now allows numbers within field names.  See the issue <a href="https://github.com/matthayes/anki_cloze_anything/issues/2" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Regex only matches the number at the end.</li>
